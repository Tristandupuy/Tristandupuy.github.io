I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in Sustainable Development at Columbia University.

My research stands at the intersection of environmental economics, empirical industrial organization and labor economics. 

Before joining Columbia, I earned master degrees in Quantitative Economics from the Paris School of Economics, and in International Relations from Sciences-Po - Paris, as well as bachelor degrees in Political Sciences (Sciences-Po), Law (Paris 1 - Sorbonne), Philosophy (Paris 10 - Nanterre), and interrupted a bachelor in Pure Mathematics during its last year at Paris 6 - UPMC. 

I also worked for a public policy consulting cabinet in Brussels, Belgium - specifically on European Union policy for the year 2013-2014, and worked one semester for the French Treasury's office within the French Embassy in Bucharest, Romania.
