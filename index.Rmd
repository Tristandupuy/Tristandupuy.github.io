I am a PhD Candidate in Sustainable Development at Columbia University. In 2026, I will join the Sciences Po Department of Economics as an Assistant Professor, following a one year postdoc at the Columbia University Center for Political Economy.

My research stands at the intersection of environmental economics and empirical industrial organization, with a focus on firm dynamics and relations between productivity and sustainability.

I use they/them pronouns.
