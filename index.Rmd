I am an economist doing research at the intersection of environmental economics and empirical industrial organization, with a focus on firm dynamics and relations between productivity and sustainability.

I am currently doing a postdoc at the Columbia University Center for Political Economy, and will join the Sciences Po Department of Economics as an Assistant Professor in fall 2026.

I use they/them pronouns.
