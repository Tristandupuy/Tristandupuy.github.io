I am a sixth-year PhD Candidate in Sustainable Development at Columbia University, and a Research Fellow at the Columbia Center for Political Economy.

My research stands at the intersection of environmental economics and empirical industrial organization, with a focus on firm dynamics and relations between productivity and sustainability.
